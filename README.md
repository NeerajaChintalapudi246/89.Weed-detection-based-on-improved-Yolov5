T# 🌿 Weed Detection using YOLOv5

This project detects weeds in crop fields using YOLOv5 + MHSA (Multi-Head Self Attention). It helps farmers identify weeds early and improve productivity.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- Django (for Web App)
- PyTorch


## 📸 Sample Result

After uploading an image, the model detects weed and gives the confidence score.
